list = ["apple", "banana", "peach", "watermelon"]
num = 1
print(list[num])
# in python, everything starts from 0
# so print(list[1]) will be the second element in the list
# and print(list[0]) will be the first element in the list
print(list[-1])
# this will return the last element in the list as what we've metioned in string
print(list[1:3])
# will start at index 1 (included) and end at index 3 (not included)
print(list[:1])
# print to the index 1 element (not included)
print(list[2:])
# print from the index 2 element (included)
# all of them work in the same way in negative number
